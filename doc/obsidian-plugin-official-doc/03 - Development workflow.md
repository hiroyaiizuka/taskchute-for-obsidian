Development workflow
Whenever you make a change to the plugin source code, the plugin needs to be reloaded. You can reload the plugin by quitting Obsidian and starting it again, but that gets tiring quickly.

Reload plugin inside Obsidian 
You can reload the plugin by re-enabling it in the list of installed plugins:

Open Preferences.
Click Community plugins.
Find your plugin under Installed plugins.
Toggle the switch off to disable the plugin.
Toggle the switch on to enable the plugin.
You're now running the updated version of your plugin.

Reload plugin on file changes 
The Hot-Reload plugin reloads your plugin whenever the source code changes.
