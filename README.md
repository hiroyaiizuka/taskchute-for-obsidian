**Execute tasks, don't just organize them - The path emerges where you walk**

TaskChute Plus brings the revolutionary TaskChute methodology to Obsidian, transforming your task management from endless planning to continuous execution.

## 🌟 The TaskChute Philosophy

Traditional task management is like a map - it shows you where to go but leaves you to figure out how. TaskChute is like GPS navigation - it tells you "turn right at the next corner" and guides you through actual execution.

### The Core Difference

| Aspect | Todo List | TaskChute |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Where to focus?** | Future (Goals) | Present |
| **Planning approach** | Plan backwards from goals | Build forward from reality |
| **Task organization** | By priority | By execution order |
| **What matters in tasks?** | Completing them | Starting them |
| **When tasks end** | They disappear | They remain as logs |
| **When stuck** | Revise the plan | Refer to the record |

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Execution-Focused Task Management**
- **Automatic task detection**: Identifies notes with `#task` tag automatically
- **Real-time status tracking**: Pending (⏸), Running (▶️), Completed (☑️)
- **1-minute rule**: Start any task for just 1 minute to achieve zero procrastination
- **Log-based routines**: Build routines from actual execution patterns, not wishful thinking

### ⏰ **Time-Based Organization**
- **Time slot management**: Organize tasks by when you'll do them (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night)
- **Dynamic task flow**: Automatic idle task migration to current time slots
- **Actual vs Estimated**: Track real time spent to improve future estimates
- **Daily constraints**: Focus on today only - tomorrow's plan is tomorrow's problem

### 📊 **Visual Progress & Reflection**
- **Daily Review**: Focus/fatigue graphs with task comments
- **Procrastination Heatmap**: GitHub-style visualization of task procrastination

### 🔄 **Smart Routine Management**
- **Flexible scheduling**: Daily, weekly, monthly patterns with specific day selection
- **History preservation**: Maintains execution history even when routine names change
- **Cross-day movement**: Enable temporary rescheduling for routine tasks
- **Pattern-based creation**: Generate routines from successful execution logs

### ⚡ **Frictionless Execution**
- **Quick capture**: Create tasks with simple `#task` tags
- **Hotkey access**: Option+T (Mac) / Alt+T (Win/Linux) for today's tasks
- **Drag & drop**: Intuitive task reorganization with visual indicators
- **Auto-completion**: Smart suggestions from existing task and project names

**Remember**: TaskChute Plus doesn't help you organize tasks better - it helps you execute them. It's not about having the perfect plan; it's about taking the next step, logging it, and building from what actually works.

> **"The path emerges where you walk"** - This is the essence of TaskChute.
