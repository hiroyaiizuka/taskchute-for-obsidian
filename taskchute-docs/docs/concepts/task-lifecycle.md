# Task Lifecycle

Understanding how tasks move through different states in TaskChute Plus.

*This page provides an overview of the complete task lifecycle from creation to completion.*

## Overview

Every task in TaskChute Plus follows a predictable lifecycle with clearly defined states and transitions. Understanding this lifecycle helps you work more effectively with the system.

## Task States

### 1. Created
- Initial state when task is first detected
- Has basic metadata (name, estimate)
- Ready for scheduling

### 2. Pending
- Task is scheduled but not started
- Appears in appropriate time slot
- Waiting for execution

### 3. Running
- Task is currently being worked on
- Timer is active
- Only one task can run at a time

### 4. Completed
- Task is finished
- Actual time recorded
- Moved to completed section

### 5. Moved/Rescheduled
- Task was moved to another day
- Preserves original estimate
- Can be moved back if needed
